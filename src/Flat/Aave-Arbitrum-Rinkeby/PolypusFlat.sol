// improvement suggestions :
// - switch to ERC1155
// - use an abstraction to support sub-collections, fungibles & ERC1155
// - use a red-black binary tree
// - optimize
// - use NFTs to represent positions
// - use custom errors
// - use wad or ray for valueToLoan
// - rename valueToLoan
// - use only singular for mappings
// - borrow less than full nft value
// - borrow from multiple markets at once
// - change Storage contract name to name not confusing with parameter type
// - create solhint plugin to disallow more than 100-lines files
// - allow callback on transfer (ofc strict reentrency checks to do)
// - add natspec to every func and contract
// - use ERC721's onERC721Received hook to auto borrow on transfer
